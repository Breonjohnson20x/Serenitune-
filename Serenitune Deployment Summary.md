# Serenitune Deployment Summary

## Slide 1: Introduction

### Deploying Serenitune: A Quick Guide

This presentation summarizes the key steps to deploy the Serenitune full-stack web application using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Slide 2: Prerequisites

### Before You Begin

Ensure you have the following installed on your deployment machine:

- **Docker**: For containerization of the application components.
- **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Git** (Optional): For cloning the repository.

## Slide 3: Step 1: Get the Code

### Clone or Download the Repository

Obtain the Serenitune source code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd serenitune
```

If you downloaded a zip, extract it and navigate into the `serenitune` directory.

## Slide 4: Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### Set Up Your Environment

Navigate to the `deployment` directory and create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cd deployment
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure:
- `SECRET_KEY`: A strong, unique secret key.
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production`.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (SQLite by default, or PostgreSQL).

## Slide 5: Step 3: Build and Start Containers

### Launch the Application

From the `deployment` directory, execute the Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker images for both frontend and backend.
- Start the containers in detached mode (runs in the background).

## Slide 6: Step 4: Verify Deployment

### Check if Everything is Running

Confirm that your containers are active:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Access the application:
- **Frontend**: Typically `http://localhost` (or your server's IP/domain).
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## Slide 7: Step 5: Initialize Database (First-time)

### Seed Your Database

For the initial setup, you need to populate the database:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python seed_database.py
```

This command runs the database seeding script inside the backend container.

## Slide 8: Stopping the Application

### Shutting Down Serenitune

To stop and remove the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Slide 9: Deployment Options & Considerations

### Beyond Localhost

- **VPS/Cloud Providers**: DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Linode.
- **Container Platforms**: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run.
- **Database**: SQLite for simple setups, PostgreSQL recommended for production.
- **SSL/TLS**: Essential for production (Nginx with Let's Encrypt, cloud load balancers).
- **Monitoring**: Set up logging and health checks.

## Slide 10: Conclusion

### You're Ready to Deploy!

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your Serenitune application.
